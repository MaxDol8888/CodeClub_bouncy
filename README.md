This is a series of Processing sketches introducing various concepts fundimental to programming. They build up from basics toward a multi-body physics simulation, in the process touching on variables, data types, conditionals, incrementing, functions, classes/objects, arrays, iteration, and probably a few other things as well.

All code is useable under the MIT license.
